        Where it began<br>
        I can't begin to knowin'<br>
        But then I know it's growin' strong<br>
        <br>
        Was in the spring<br>
        And spring became the summer<br>
        Who'd have believed you'd come along<br>
        <br>
        Hands, touchin' hands<br>
        Reachin' out, touchin' me, touchin' you<br>
        <br>
        Sweet Caroline<br>
        Good times never seemed so good<br>
        I've been inclined<br>
        To believe they never would<br>
        But now I...<br>
        <br>
        ...look at the night<br>
        And it don't seem so lonely<br>
        We fill it up with only two<br>
        <br>
        And when I hurt<br>
        Hurtin' runs off my shoulders<br>
        How can I hurt when holdin' you?<br>
        <br>
        Warm, touchin' warm<br>
        Reachin' out, touchin' me, touchin' you<br>
        <br>
        Sweet Caroline<br>
        Good times never seemed so good<br>
        I've been inclined<br>
        To believe they never would<br>
        Oh, no, no<br>
        <br>
        Sweet Caroline<br>
        Good times never seemed so good<br>
        Sweet Caroline<br>
        I believed they never could<br>
        <br>
        Sweet Caroline<br>
        Good times never seemed so good...
